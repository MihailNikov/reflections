How did	viewing a diff between
helps you spot the bug?
You easily see where is the
difference between the files
and you do not have to scan the
entire file with your eyes.

Where do versions come from?
Versions are usefull for tracking
changes in documents.

Why do you think some version control systems,
like Git, allow saving multiple files in
one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
treat each file separately?
They allow it because it is needed.
Some projects may be comprised of multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log
and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log you view all recent commits
With git diff you see the particular changes to
the files that were made with the commits.

How might using version control make
you more confident to make changes
that could break something?
It give you access to older versions
of your code.
