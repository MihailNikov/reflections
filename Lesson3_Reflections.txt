When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?
-You would want to use a remote repository for 
several reasons.First, if you are working with
other people, it would be useful, because you
would be able to work on the project together.
Second, if the project you are working is 
critical, you would not want your drive to be 
the single place where you hold your project,
because your storage can fail, which will leave
you without your project.
