When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?
-You would want to use a remote repository for
several reasons.First, if you are working with
other people, it would be useful, because you
would be able to work on the project together.
Second, if the project you are working is
critical, you would not want your drive to be
the single place where you hold your project,
because your storage can fail, which will leave
you without your project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository?
-One reason that comes to mind is that git does not know
the logic of your project, and because of that, it can
probably make some confusing commits that would not
be very useful to you if you wanted to go back and
check some of the work you have done.
